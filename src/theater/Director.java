/**
 * The Director class has the following attributes
 * <P>
 *                                                      EXAMPLE
 * Inherits data fields from person class
 * 5. Hired for which play				Cabaret
 * 6. Pay scale per hour				$30.00
 * 7. Actor's Equity?					boolean
 * 8.  Up front fee					$450.00
 * 9.  Percentage of house				15%
 * 10.  Hours worked per week                           50
 * 
 * The method for CalculatePay for a director is to pass in the up front fee, the pay 
 * scale per hour, and a 1 if the Actor's Equity boolean is true or 0 if false.  The 
 * pay is then calculated one of two ways based on the boolean value.  
 * If the Actor's Equity boolean was false then the 
 * actor's pay equals up front fee
 * If the Actor's Equity boolean was true then the pay calculation is:
 * actor's pay equals up front fee PLUS
 * 	the greater of ((hours per week â€“ 40) * pay per hour)  OR 0 (zero)
 * [ There is extra pay for over 40 hours a week if the director is part of Equity]
 * 
 * Directors will also have a method for PerformancePay which will be based on the 
 * total ticket sales for all shows taking the gross revenue for ticket sales and 
 * determining 15% of the gross revenue.  This percentage of the house is the pay 
 * the director receives for the complete run of the play and all performances.
 * <P>
